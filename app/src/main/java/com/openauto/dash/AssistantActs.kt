/*
 * What Dashwheel's Gemini ([DashAssistant], [AssistantTools]) does for the
 * driver beyond a wheel button: call someone, text the arrival time, guide
 * home or to work, add a fuel or parking stop, the parking timer, a refuel
 * in the fuel log. Each goes through what the tiles and buttons already use
 * (PhoneLink, OnMyWay, NavHandoff, FuelPriceRepo, ParkingClock, FuelLog).
 *
 * The answers go back to Gemini, which says them in the driver's language:
 * nothing here speaks, so the car's voice never talks over Gemini's.
 * Calls and texts happen only once Gemini has said the person's name and the
 * driver agreed ("confirmed"), and only to a name that matched one person.
